#### Task 2

Modify App.jsx in such way that it displays three tables:
1) students attending Codebrainers bootcamp
2) students attending "some other" bootcamp
3) table with students attending both bootcamps at the same time.
(according to current criteria Marharyta and Kamil attend both bootcamps at the same time).

Algorithm should be generic, i.e. it should work properly with other set of students as long as both sets
are JS arrays of Student-class based items.

#### Task 3

Make first table sorted by Full Name ascending.
Make second table sorted by Frequency descending.

Tip: modify sorting method in such way that it accepts two parameters (i.e. field we should sort over and direction
(asc/desc)).

#### Task 4**

Make third table sorted by number of beers descending and then full name ascending.
